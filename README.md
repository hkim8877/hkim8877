## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
<h1 align="center">ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub! ðŸš€</h1>

Iâ€™m Jean, a curious mind and aspiring software engineer studying at Hive Helsinki, where Iâ€™m diving deep into the world of code through the 42 Cursus.

ðŸ”Ž I enjoy exploring how things work under the hood and turning complex challenges into elegant, efficient solutions.

ðŸŒ± Continuously experimenting with new ideas, learning from every project, and expanding my skills with each challenge I tackle.
